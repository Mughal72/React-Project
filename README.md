## Basic React Project With Laravel 

**Project Name: E-Commerce Dashboard**

1. **Overview**:
   - The E-Commerce Dashboard project aims to create a comprehensive management system for an online store.
   - It integrates the **Laravel** backend for API development and the **React** frontend for dynamic user interfaces.

2. **Frontend**:
   - The frontend is built using **React** and includes several key components:
     - **Routes**: The project defines routes for different pages, such as login, registration, product management, and search.
     - **Protected Routes**: Certain routes (e.g., adding, updating, and searching products) are protected and require authentication.
     - **Components**: Components like `Login`, `Register`, `AddProduct`, `UpdateProduct`, `SearchProduct`, and `ProductList` handle specific functionalities.

3. **Backend**:
   - The backend is developed in **Laravel** and provides RESTful APIs for communication with the frontend.
   - Key API endpoints include:
     - User registration and login (`/register`, `/login`).
     - Product management (`/addProduct`, `/list`, `/delete/{id}`, `/product/{id}`, `/updateproduct/{id}`, `/search/{key}`).
     - Data storage in a **MySQL** database.

4. **Functionality**:
   - **Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely.
   - **Product Management**: Admins can add, update, delete, and search for products.
   - **User Profiles**: User information is stored in the database.
   - **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes.

5. **Testing**:
   - APIs have been tested using **Postman** to ensure proper functionality.
   - Frontend components should also be thoroughly tested.
